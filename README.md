🧠 How It Works...

# Solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.

# For a given value of N, it:

# Finds all valid placements of N queens on an N×N chessboard.

# Ensures no two queens threaten each other (no same row, column, or diagonal).

# Displays each solution visually on dynamically generated boards.

# Includes animation that progresses at a speed chosen by the user.
