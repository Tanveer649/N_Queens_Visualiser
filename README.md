- 🎯 Dynamic board generation – Chessboard updates based on N value.
- 🧠 All possible arrangements shown – Visualises all valid configurations.
- ⏱️ Speed control slider – Adjust the visualisation speed from SLOW to FAST.
- 🎮 Interactive UI – Simple play button to start the process.

## 🧩 How It Works

**Solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.**

### For a given value of N, it:

- ✅ **Finds all valid placements of N queens** on an N×N chessboard.
- ❌ **Ensures no two queens threaten each other** (no same row, column, or diagonal).
- 📊 **Displays each solution visually** on dynamically generated boards.
- 🌀 **Includes animation** that progresses at a speed chosen by the user.
